# Load Balancer

## Problem Statement

Implement a load balancer that distributes requests across backend servers using multiple algorithms.

### Requirements

1. Round-robin, weighted round-robin, and least-connections algorithms
2. Health checking: remove unhealthy backends, re-add when recovered
3. Thread-safe for concurrent requests
