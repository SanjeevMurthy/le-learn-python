# Module 15: Real-World Projects

## Overview

Complete working projects that combine multiple concepts from the toolkit. Each project is a standalone solution for a real DevOps/SRE challenge.

## Projects

| Project                            | Description                             | Concepts Used                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `automated-deployment-pipeline/`   | End-to-end deployment automation        | CI/CD, Docker, health checks, rollback |
| `infrastructure-health-dashboard/` | System health monitoring dashboard      | Metrics, alerting, visualization       |
| `cost-optimization-tool/`          | Cloud cost analysis and recommendations | AWS APIs, data processing, reporting   |
| `log-analysis-platform/`           | Centralized log analysis                | Log parsing, anomaly detection, search |
| `disaster-recovery-automation/`    | DR runbook automation                   | Backups, failover, PITR, verification  |

## How to Use

Each project directory contains:

- `README.md` — Project overview, setup instructions, architecture
- Source files implementing the project
- Configuration examples

## Key Interview Topics

1. **Architecture decisions** — Why certain tools/patterns were chosen
2. **Trade-offs** — Cost vs performance, consistency vs availability
3. **Production readiness** — Logging, monitoring, error handling
4. **Scalability** — How the solution handles growth
